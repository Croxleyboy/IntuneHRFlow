## Description

IntuneHRFlow is a Powerfull Microsoft focused solution that simplifies and automates the Onboarding and Offboarding of Employees.
This is an integrated solution rather than a piece of code and therefore does require some setup. When setup you will have an automated process utilising multiple Microsoft products. The Result being a seamless solution for both HR processes and backend IT Admin tasks for Intune and Entra. To make it a solution we have integrated multiple Microsoft products to introduce automation to HR processes including:
- Employee Onboarding
- Employee Offboarding
- Asset Management (devices registered and enrolled with Intune)
- Application requests with approval ( for assignment to Intune Assigned applications)
- Persona mapping ( A useful way of mapping user roles to defined profiles - Apps and policies) - Not yet released
- Workflow tracker
- Admin Upflift
